# Android Clean Project with Dependency Injection

A clean, modular, and scalable **Android project** built with **Kotlin** and **Dependency Injection**.  
This template is designed as a starting point for Android apps, with **DI modules**, **utility classes**, and a maintainable structure inspired by **Clean Architecture** principles.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**
    - App-wide and Activity-specific modules
    - Centralized management of dependencies
- **Clean Architecture Inspired**
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Easy to extend for real-world apps
- **Reusable Utilities**
    - Network, Storage, File, Image, Navigation, and Device helpers
- **Ready for Testing**
    - Decoupled dependencies for easier unit and instrumentation tests

---

## 💡 Why Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is at the heart of this project. It enables:

- **Scalability** – Add new features without touching existing code
- **Testability** – Easily mock and inject dependencies in tests
- **Maintainability** – Keeps classes independent and modular
- **Reusability** – Shared dependencies managed in a central place

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** – Modern Android development
- **Dependency Injection** – Using Dagger/Hilt-style modules
- **AndroidX & Jetpack** – Lifecycle, DataStore, etc.
- **Data Persistence** – Jetpack DataStore & SharedPreferences
- **Utility Layer** – Ready-to-use helpers for networking, navigation, storage, etc.

## 📦 Utilities Included

- `DeviceHelper` – Device information utilities
- `FileHelper` – File operations (read/write)
- `ImageHelper` – Image handling utilities
- `NavigationHelper` – Simplified screen navigation
- `NetworkHelper` – Network connectivity checks
- `ToastHelper` – Quick toast display
- `DataStoreHelper` – DataStore helper
- `PreferenceHelper` – SharedPreferences wrapper
